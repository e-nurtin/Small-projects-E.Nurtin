#Small projects I made learning Python!

All projects are terminal based.

-----------------------------------------------

## 1. Guess the Number
A game where you need to guess the number picked by AI. Each time you guess right the number increment of AI to choose from increases! You have limited lives!

-----------------------------------------------

## 2. Hangman
Hangman game where you can play against AI or PvP. It also has interesting terminal drawing.

-----------------------------------------------

## 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors
What kind of developer would I be if I didn't make this classic ?

-----------------------------------------------

## 4. Tic, Tac, Toe
I plan on doing this on GUI, once I get the chance!

-----------------------------------------------
Feel free to use and\or improve any of my work!
